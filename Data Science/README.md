# Data Science Projects

Data Science caught my interest since the last year of my undergrad, where I was introduced to subjects like Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Mining. Studying Machine Learning, a vast field of Data Science has allowed me to implement prediction and classification algorithms like Decision Tree, Regression, SVM, and so on. So far, I have applied Machine Learning to solve prediction, classification, and regression problems. Along with this, I have developed several data visualisation reports/projects to provide key relationships and product analysis to assist in making business strategic decisions.
