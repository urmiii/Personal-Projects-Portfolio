# Placement Prediction using Weka
The objective is to present a proposed model based on a classification approach to finding an enhanced evaluation method for predicting the placement for students. This model can determine the relations between the academic achievement of students and their placement in campus selection.

# Steps
  1. Open file in Weka
  2. Choose algorithm classfication algorithm REPTree
  3. Pass the test dataset using the option 'Supplied test set'
  4. View the decision tree from Result list
  Repeat the same process for RandomTree algorithm and compare the predicitions
