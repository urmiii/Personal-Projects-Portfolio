# A Bit About Me!
Hello, I am Urmi!👋🏼 
Welcome to my Project Portfolio! I am a recent graduate with a major in Computer Engineering and core subjects like Machine Learning/AI, Website Development, and Data Mining. Currently, I am a full-time Freelancer providing website/software development, data analytics, and content writing services. My pivotal moment is when my team and I developed a creative solution for the Netherlands NASA SpaceApps challenge, using machine learning and GIS to address the wildfire disasters happening around the world, and won the competition.  
I am focusing on developing my technical skills as well as expanding my network in the IT field.
