#Know Your Pulsars

The website presents several features related to cosmological field. Major features include, prediction of distance between planets as well as pulsar detection.

#Features
ðŸ’« Calculate Distance of Earth from Sun 

ðŸ’« Calculate Ephemeris Time of Earth

ðŸ’« Calculate Orbital Speed of Earth around Sun

ðŸ’« Detect Pulsars

#Notes
The data to calculate distance, time, and speed is fetched from NASA's open data library. 
Some pulsars rotates once a second, some 10x a second, so we will be able to catch the image only when it is directly pulsating towards us. So, this project will combine n images and combine them. The output image will show the night sky with higher brighter intensity in order to highlight the pulsar signal more efficiently.
