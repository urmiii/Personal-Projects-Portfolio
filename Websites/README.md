# Website Development Projects
I started creating websites in my second year of undergrad. I started website development using only HTML and CSS, and eventually got a grip at other languages such as PHP, Laravel, WordPress and JS. As opposed to Back-end development, Front-end highly captivated me to create appealing webpages and integrate engaging bootstrap. So far, I have developed website projects for domains such as Event Management and Education Sector. The constant growth of web technology excites me to learn and apply my knowledge in creating websites.
