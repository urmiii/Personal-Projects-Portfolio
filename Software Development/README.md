# Software Development Projects

I was introduced to software development in my last two years of undergrad. In order to create worthy desktop software, I acquired knowledge of languages like Python and its libraries such as PyQT5/Pyside2 and Tkinter for GUI. My interest and aptitude for software development allowed me to create applications in several domains such as Management and IT Sector. Working on Software Development projects allow me to put an end to problems in a creative way by building a whole new application and fitting everything together to simplify things.
